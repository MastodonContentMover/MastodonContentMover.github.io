Adds parameter to allow disabling of idempotency key for testing purposes, applies latest Bigbone library snapshot (required for previous) and increases the value of the extra throttle used when overriding default settings to repost statuses to public timelines.
<ul>
  <li>adding <code>testMode</code> parameter to disable idempotency key when testing</li>
  <li>switching from Bigbone library snapshot version 2.0.0-20230719.193107-19 to bigbone-2.0.0-20230818.202222-21</li>
  <li>adjusting the extra throttle applied when overriding default settings to repost statuses to public timelines, which was added in release v0.01.04 in response to feedback from instance administrators, from 30 seconds to 60 seconds</li>
</ul>

<b>Development release v0.01.05</b> - <i>Sunday July 30, 2023</i><br /><br />
Applies a fix to prevent corruption of the archive if duplicate Mastodon instance ids are returned for reposted statuses, due to changes to the BigBone library, and increases the value of the extra throttle used when overriding default settings to repost statuses to public timelines (which was added in release v0.01.04 in response to feedback from instance administrators).
<ul>
  <li>adding defensive coding to Post objects to identify an attempt to add a duplicate Mastodon instance ID</li>
  <li>adjusting the extra throttle applied when overriding default settings to repost statuses to public timelines, which was added in release v0.01.04 in response to feedback from instance administrators, from 20 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
  <li>rationalising Post code to remove redundant (duplicate) method</li>
</ul>
Please note, previous development release v0.01.04 was mistakenly committed to the Github repository on July 25 with the message "Development release v0.01.03", duplicating the message on the earlier commit of June 9. The version committed to Github on July 25 should have been named "Development release v0.01.04". Apologies for any confusion.
